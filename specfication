- Write a server that listens for incoming TCP connections.
- Upon receiving a connection, it should spawn a GenServer to track a counter
- A client can send `INCREMENT` or `DECREMENT` commands to increment or decrement the counter
- A client can send `READ` command to read the current value of the counter
- The server can handle multiple connections, each with its own counter
- Invalid commands are responded to with an error message
- README explains how to test the server manually
